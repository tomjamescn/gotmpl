Template generation tools stands for GOlang TeMPLate.

Maybe [Mustache for Golang](https://github.com/cbroglie/mustache) is already a good solution for template generation, BUT, it is not perfect because it has not folder name including tempalte palceholder, more binding data input format, comment for binding data and etc.

#feature
- using [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) sytanx for template file
- directory name can be used as template
- json file, yaml file and input arguments as binding data
- comment for binding data
- may be more...

# prequire
```sh
go get github.com/cbroglie/mustache/...
```

# use
